<h1>Perl 6 Projects by supernovus</h1>
<p>
Not much to see here yet, this will eventually be a dynamically
generated page built with ww6 and will feature full descriptions
of all my Perl 6 projects hosted on github.

<p>
Since it's not ready yet, <a href="http://github.com/supernovus/">click here</a>
to visit my Github profile.
