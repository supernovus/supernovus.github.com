<h1>Garden -- A Functional Template Language</h1>
<h2>VERSION 1-RC2</h2>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>
The ability to make notes in your templates, either for documentation
or to add a private TODO note for yourself, is very useful.
Sometimes you even want to be able to comment out an entire section of your
template while testing things. Both of these abilities are possible in
Garden, with a configurable syntax too boot.
</p>
<p class="note">
All of the comment related syntax below applies inside template and
dictionary blocks.
You can use them outside of blocks, but it's not really necessary, as
any text outside a block that isn't a statement, or a block definition,
is ignored.
</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>
A note is a quick comment, that ends with a newline character.
In Garden, the note prefix must either be the first character of the
line, or have white space in front of it to be recognized.
</p>
<code class="block">
<i class="t">myTemplate</i> () <u>{{</u>
Hello World <u>##</u> <tt>Everything after the <u>##</u> marks is a note comment.</tt>
<u>##</u> <tt>This line in its entirety is a note comment.</tt>
This is not a comment.
<u>}}</u>
</code>
<p class="note">
The <i class="s">##</i> symbol is customizable. See the Overriding Syntax section for more details.
</p>

<h4>Comment Blocks</h4>
<p>
If you want to comment out an entire block, you can do so with special
comment symbols:
</p>
<code class="block">
<i class="t">myTemplate</i> () <u>{{</u>
Hello <u>/*</u> <tt>Everything past that symbol is a comment.
Including this line.
And this text.</tt> <u>*/</u> World. (This is not a comment.)
<u>}}</u>
</code>
<p class="note">
The <i class="s">/*</i> and <i class="s">*/</i> symbols are
customizable. See the Overriding Syntax section for more details.
