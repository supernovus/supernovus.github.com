<h1>Garden -- A Functional Template Language</h1>
<h2>VERSION 1-RC2</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Garden is a general-purpose functional template langauge. It doesn't
care what it's source textual format is and offers a great deal of flexibility 
without forcing too much application logic into your templates.
</p>
<p>
It offers a very different approach to recursion (looping) and conditional
sections of templates than most template engines, having been inspired by
StringTemplate (a Java-based functional template engine) and my own previous 
project: Flower (a Perl 6 XML Application Engine, with a TAL/METAL template
language included.)
</p>
<p>
One of the defining features of Garden is that it is very customizable.
It offers a flexible way to override certain syntax, to ensure the Garden
statements don't conflict with the textual content of your templates.
It also offers optional extensions that individual implementations may
choose to implement, and templates can request individually.
</p>
<p>
This specification defines the full language, as well as a few recommended
extensions. An implementation must implement all non-extension features
in order to comply with the specification.
